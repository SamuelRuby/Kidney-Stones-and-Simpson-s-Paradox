# Kidney-Stones-and-Simpson-s-Paradox

In 1986, a group of urologists in London published a research paper in The British Medical Journal that compared the effectiveness of two different methods to remove kidney stones. Treatment A was open surgery (invasive), and treatment B was percutaneous nephrolithotomy (less invasive). When they looked at the results from 700 patients, treatment B had a higher success rate. However, when they only looked at the subgroup of patients different kidney stone sizes, treatment A had a better success rate. What is going on here? This known statistical phenomenon is called Simpon’s paradox. Simpon's paradox occurs when trends appear in subgroups but disappear or reverse when subgroups are combined.
In this notebook, we are going to explore Simpon’s paradox using multiple regression and other statistical tools.
